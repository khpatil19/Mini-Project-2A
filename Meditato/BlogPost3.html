      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> Most of us live in a bipolar state and I don’t mean bipolar disorder.
        We live between two polarities – the Ego Mind and the True Self. You may have heard me say before, that the
        human race is experiencing an evolution. The more we embrace this evolution by being willing to grow and become
        present, the more we will be living as our True Self. Nothing happens overnight however, unless we are lucky
        enough to be struck by the wand of enlightenment in our sleep – and it does happen for some, such as Eckhart
        Tolle (after much suffering may I add). However most of us will be dipping in and out of our True Self.
        Sometimes our Ego Mind will dominate and sometimes our True Self will be in charge, and that’s OK and normal.
        This is where awareness is very valuable.

        The Ego mind vs the True self

        What is the difference between the ego mind and the True Self?
        Our ego mind is our false self – the conditioned self – who is not in touch with who we really are. It feeds on
        the vibration of fear and lives through a paradigm of Win/Lose (I win and therefore you must lose – also known
        as competition). When we are in ego we will feel contracted and small and “all alone”, and so we seek POWER. Ego
        power can feel good and it’s very addictive. Think of times when someone has hurt you and you seek to “get your
        own back”. It can feel wonderful at the time, but the good effect is short-lived, and often regretted. The ego
        mind can also be needy. It does not want to lose anything and so it clings to people, places and situations.
        When we are in our ego mind, we will be dominated by the emotions of envy, jealousy, guilt, anger, resentment
        and other toxic emotions as well as loneliness. We can also experience feel-good emotions – excitement, elation
        and ecstasy, but these never last. When they go, we drop down to the same disconnected, lonely feeling that
        existed before, which can feel devastating. So the ego mind will have us experiencing an emotional rollercoaster
        of ups and downs. The ego doesn’t like to feel bad and so it looks for quick-fixes and is the basis of all
        addictions. The ego worries about what other people think of us and acts from an outside point of view as
        opposed to being self-directed, and just as it fears judgment; it also judges others, creating separation,
        loneliness and isolation.

        What is true happiness?
        There are a lot of books out there on happiness. True happiness is the state of inner peace and serenity. Some
        of us don’t recognise that this is happiness – so conditioned are we that we think happiness is excitement,
        elation and ecstasy – but these emotions are always short-lived. As human beings, we do not have the energy to
        sustain such a state of being for that long. What comes up must come down. The more we seek thrills, the more
        depression and despair we also experience. Our lives will certainly include moments of peak experiences, but the
        more in touch with our True Self we are, the more we do not identify with the thrill. We can enjoy it for what
        it is, but not cling to it, or hope that it will last, or take it too seriously, knowing that “this too shall
        pass”.

        How can we begin to connect more with our True Self?
        We can only start this journey to the True Self from where we are today. There are no shortcuts. We need to
        fully embrace who we are right now – we don’t get anywhere by denying our ego. The only way to transcend the ego
        mind is by: Bringing AWARENESS to it Realising there is a SPACE between the ego mind’s desire and our action
        Choosing to transcend the ego’s desires with the vibration of LOVE.
        Asking the question “What would love do now?” is a powerful question.
        Here are further ways of becoming present and getting more in touch with your True Self : Practise presence and
        observation – Whenever you can, become aware of the present moment – right here, right now – and simply observe
        it. Simply observe without thought. Set an alarm on your phone two or three times a day, or put a few signs
        around your home or work space with the word PRESENCE or NOW to remind you to make contact with the present
        moment right now.
        1. Meditate – Sitting with yourself and observing your thoughts, emotions, agitations and distractions is a
        highly effective way to become self-aware. Pay attention to your breath – This is a great way to become more
        present. Again, if you’re new to this, set an alarm on your phone two or three times daily to practise.
        2. Feel your body – The body is not the busy ego-mind. Feeling the inside of our body brings awareness. The body
        is constantly talking to you, telling you the truth. When you connect in with your body, you disconnect from
        your busy ego-mind. Observe nature – Simply by sitting and observing nature, you are connecting in with the
        Universal Source.
        3. Yoga/exercise – Undertake exercise in a self-observant way. Notice your breath, feel your bodily sensations,
        observe your thoughts. Stay present.
        4. Do something you love or do something creative – When you are fully engaged in a create activity that you
        enjoy, you can feel totally present and connected, and the ego mind falls away. Paint, write, build, decorate,
        sew, knit, garden, colour-in, play – whatever gives you joy creatively, make some time to do it.
