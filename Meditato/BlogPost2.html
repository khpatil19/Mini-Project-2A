      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> What are emotions?
        Let’s start by exploring a basic understanding of emotions that will likely be dramatically different than what
        you have believed up to this point. What we think of as emotion is the experience of energy moving through the
        body. This is Bodymind connection and E-emotion

        generally felt as sensations of contraction such as tension or expansion such as calm. The Latin derivative for
        the word emotion, ‘emotere’, literally means energy in motion. Researcher Barbara Frederickson furthered this
        understanding by describing the upward and downward spiral effect of emotion. An upward spiral correlates with
        expansion and feelings such as joy and happiness. A downward spiral correlates with contraction and feelings
        such as resentment and fear.

        Emotional Energy
        As a result of these findings, the emotional brain is considered to have executive power in the brain. It
        influences all decision making, thought processes, memories, and present experiences. Your ability to
        understand, deal with, and effectively use your emotional energy is vital to your happiness levels. The
        sensations you feel in your body hold the key to unlocking limiting patterns, transforming stress, and
        generating lasting happiness. Your body gives a constant stream of reliable information about your experience in
        the form of sensation. It’s a library of who you are at the deepest level, including all that has happened to
        you and all that you dream about. Understanding your body sensations will transform your life.6 For many people,
        looking to their body sensations to transform challenging emotions and increase emotional intelligence is the
        most important piece of the puzzle that leads to happiness. This is especially true when you understand that
        sensory and emotional information is recorded into memory first; thoughts and perceptions, second. This
        distinction provides clues for increasing emotional intelligence while pointing out the limitations of purely
        thought-based approaches.

        Driven to Move E-Motion
        The drive to move your emotional energy is present every moment because your nervous system is in constant
        pursuit of homeostasis. It’s on a mission 24/7 regulating the balance of your bodymind connection. This often
        includes your instinctual drive to be happy by releasing any pent-up stress. You have an opportunity to move
        your emotional energy each time you experience contraction, tension, or any other body sensations. They are the
        internal messages of your bodymind wisdom that draw you toward balance and happiness. Given the understanding
        that emotion is actually energy in motion it is important to distinguish what it looks and feels like to
        increase your emotional awareness. Most people believe this looks like using their thinking mind to analyze,
        think about and talk about how they feel. Although this approach can bring initial awareness it is not effective
        in the long run. It is common from this approach to hinder the process of expressing and managing emotions. In
        doing so, it keeps the process of expression at the level of thought vs. actual feeling or energy movement. In
        order to successfully express emotion you have to move your emotional energy by identifying the sensations and
        releasing states of contraction.
